# ![[Intro to Full Stack Development] - Common Stacks Used in Modern Web Development](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will know about some of the most popular web development stacks used today. 


## What is a stack?

A web development stack is a combination of programming languages, frameworks, and databases that are used to build and maintain web applications in full stack development. 

There are a lot of stacks available, but some common ones are the **MEN stack**, the **MERN stack**, and **Python-Django-Postgres**.

### The MEN stack

The MEN stack is made up of the following technologies:

- **MongoDB**
- **Express.js**
- **Node.js**

tktk hunter -- this is ugly can you redo plz

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment, and Express.js is a web application framework specfically for Node.js. 

MongoDB and Node.js are very fast technologies, which means the MEN stack is considered a high performance stack. It is also highly scalable, capable of handling a large number of concurrent users and requests. Lastly, it's fairly easy for new developers to use due in large part to the fact that Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. This allows developers to leverage their existing JavaScript skills to develop the server side of the web applications. 


### The MERN stack

The MERN stack is very similar to the MEN stack, but it also uses React. 

React is a front end framework known for its component-based architecture. Web developers use React to build user interfaces that are reusable and maintainable. Additionally, React is very performant, so it's a great choice for developing web applications that need to be fast and responsive.

tktk hunter -- please add some pizazz 

### Python-Django-Postgres

This stack is made up of the following technologies:

- **Python**: a general-purpose programming language.
- **Django**: a Python web framework.
- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database management system.
