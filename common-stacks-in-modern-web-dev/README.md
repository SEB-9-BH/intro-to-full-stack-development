# ![[Intro to Full Stack Development] - Common Stacks Used in Modern Web Apps](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will know about some of the most popular web development stacks used today.

tktk Hunter, This microlesson could really use some visual interest, but I'm unsure what should go in here.

## What is a stack?

A web development stack is a combination of programming languages, large libraries/frameworks, and databases that store application data.

There are a lot of stacks available, but some common ones are the **MEN stack**, the **MERN stack**, and **Python, Django, and Postgres**.

### The MEN stack

The MEN stack is made up of the following technologies:

- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)**
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)**
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)**

Node.js is used to execute JavaScript outside of the browser. Express.js is a web application framework specifically for Node.js. Like any framework, Express.js is not required to build web applications executed using Node.js, but it makes building these apps much more efficient for us as developers. MongoDB will be used to persist our data in a MongoDB database.

Node.js and Express.js are highly scalable and capable of handling many concurrent users and requests. Newer JavaScript developers can learn this stack more easily because it allows them to leverage their existing JavaScript skills to develop the server side of web applications.

### The MERN stack

The MERN stack is very similar to the MEN stack, but it adds React to handle composing a user interface.

- **MongoDB**
- **Express.js**
- **Node.js**
- **[React](https://react.dev/)**

React is a front-end framework known for its component-based architecture. Web developers use React to build user interfaces that are reusable, maintainable, fast, and responsive.

### Python, Django, and Postgres

This stack is made up of the following technologies:

- **[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/)**
- **[Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/)**
- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)**

Python is one of the most widely used technologies by developers, and Django is the most commonly used framework for building web applications in Python. Postgres is one of the most popular relational databases in the world. This stack is similar to the MEN stack. Here's how the technologies match up:

- **JavaScript** -> **Python**: the programming language
- **Express** -> **Django**: the framework, used to make building the application easier
- **MongoDB** -> **PostgreSQL**: the database, used to store application data
