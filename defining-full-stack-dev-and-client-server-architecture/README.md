# ![[Intro to Full Stack Development] - Defining Full Stack Development and Client/Server Architecture](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to define full stack development and client/server architecture.

## What is full stack development?

[Full stack development](https://www.mongodb.com/languages/full-stack-development) is the practice of building web applications from both the front-end (user-facing) and back-end (server-side) perspectives. Full stack developers deeply understand front and back end technologies. They are able to work on all aspects of a web application, from designing the user interface to developing the sever-side logic. 

In addition to the front-end and back-end components, full stack developers also need to have a good understanding of databases. Databases are used to store and manage the application's data. Common database technologies include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

tktk hunter -- i stole this asset from the mongodb link above, but i think it's helpful. might be worth remaking but i defer to your judgement. Also this doesnt work in dark mode lol.

Full stack developers need to be able to design and implement database [*schemas*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/database-schema), query the database to retrieve and manipulate data, and optimize database performance.

## What is client/server architecture?

Client/server architecture is a system design pattern that divides an application into two parts: a client (which interacts with a user) and a server (which stores and processes data). 

## How do full stack development and client/server architecture work together?

Full stack development and client/server architecture are closely related. Understanding client/server architecture is critical in order to build scalable, reliable, and secure web applications. 

Here's one example of how full stack development and client/server architecture work together:

  1. A user navigates to a website in their browser (the browser is the client).
  2. The browser sends a request to the website's server, which is responsible for storing and processing the website's data. 
  3. The server processes the request, and sends a response back to the browser.
  4. The browser displays the response to the user.
