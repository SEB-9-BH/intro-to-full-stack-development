**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to distinguish between frameworks and libraries in software development, understand their roles and benefits, and recognize the differences between opinionated and unopinionated frameworks.

## What are frameworks and libraries?

Frameworks and libraries are vital tools in software development. They leverage pre-written code to help accomplish common tasks without starting that work from scratch. While they both aid in development, they serve different purposes:

- A *framework* provides the overarching structure for an application. It typically offers a set of rules or conventions to help standardize development. This means different applications built using the same framework will broadly look the same (for example, they'll have a similar directory structure).

- A *library* offers specific functionalities that developers can integrate into their projects as needed. Libraries handle specific tasks like working with dates, formatting strings, and presenting UI elements. They don't enforce how the overall application is structured or behaves.

This analogy from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/) outlines the difference:

> A library is like browsing an Ikea catalog. You already have a home, but you need a bit of help with furniture. You donâ€™t feel like making your own table from scratch. Ikea allows you to pick and choose different things to go in your home. You are in control.
>
> A framework, on the other hand, is like building a model home. You have a set of blueprints and a few limited choices when it comes to architecture and design. Ultimately, the contractor and blueprint are in control. And they will let you know when and where you can provide your input.

## Benefits of using frameworks and libraries

You can create full-stack applications without using frameworks or libraries, but this makes the process more complicated and time-consuming. It frequently involves developing features from scratch that are readily available in existing frameworks or libraries.

> ðŸ§  It's important to note that libraries and frameworks are not programming languages themselves. They are built using languages like JavaScript, Python, etc.

They make a developer's job easier by:

- **Simplifying complex tasks:** They handle the complicated parts of coding by *abstracting* them, which boosts developer productivity and development speed. This is because they hide the complex details and let developers work at a simpler level.

- **Offering tested solutions:** Many frameworks and libraries are widely used and have been tested by many other developers. This means they are generally more reliable than code written from scratch.

- **Providing community support:** The large community of users is a great resource for solving problems and getting help, as they share a lot of knowledge and experience.

> ðŸ“š *Abstraction* hides technical complexity and details irrelevant to solving a problem. It allows programmers to interact with complex systems at a simplified level without understanding the underlying information.

## Types of frameworks

There are many different types of frameworks, but they can be broadly categorized into two groups: opinionated and unopinionated.

### Opinionated

Opinionated frameworks encourage or enforce a particular way of doing things as dictated by the framework. Put another way, they prefer ***conventions*** over ***configuration***. There are a few advantages to this approach.

- **Rapid development**: Setup and configuration are typically minimized. Apps can be built from the start with sensible defaults configured, making it easier to start a project.
- **Consistency**: Developers have fewer decisions to make due to enforced conventions. This can make it easier for multiple developers to work together on teams or get onboarded to work more quickly.
- **Best practices**: App configuration can be complicated and error-prone - opinionated frameworks try to do that work so you don't have to.
- **Debugging**: Because there is less customization, developers are less likely to encounter unique errors.

### Unopinionated

Unopinionated frameworks are the opposite of opinionated frameworks, allowing developers more freedom in their projects. Since these frameworks are the inverse of opinionated, they prefer ***configuration*** over ***convention***. Once again, there are a few benefits to this approach:

- **Flexibility**: Unopinionated frameworks provide the freedom to choose the best path to solve a problem.
- **Ease of customization**: Unopionated frameworks are ideal for projects that require significant customization or when an established convention is unhelpful.
- **Lightweight**: Unopinionated frameworks often only include the minimal parts necessary for a project.

### Trade-offs

So which are better, unopinionated or opinionated frameworks? There's no straightforward answer to this because each exists to solve different kinds of problems, and the benefits of each come with trade-offs.

For example, when using an opinionated framework, developers must learn and follow a rigid structure given by the framework. This makes the learning curve steeper but comes with the trade-off that code written by different developers with the same framework will be more consistent. Similarly, unopinionated frameworks allow for more customization, but that means more decisions have to be made, which can slow down meaningful development.

Luckily, as a junior developer, it's unlikely you will make decisions about which of these to use to build applications in an organization, but beginning to understand the nuances between frameworks/libraries and opinionated/unopinionated frameworks will help you develop a deeper understanding of the differences between different tech stacks.
