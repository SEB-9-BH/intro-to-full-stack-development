# ![Intro to Full Stack Development - The Building Blocks of Full Stack Web Apps](./assets/hero.png)

**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to define the three components of a full stack: front-end, back-end, and database.

## Front-end

The front-end of a web application is the part that users interact with directly. It displays the user interface, handles user input, and, if necessary, communicates with a back-end via a *request*.

Browsers natively support HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the core technologies of front-end development.

- **Key Technologies**:
  - **HTML**: Structures the web page.
  - **CSS**: Styles the web page.
  - **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the web page.

- **Popular Tools**: Frameworks and libraries that assist in front-end development include:
  - Angular
  - Vue.js
  - React
  - jQuery

tktk hunter -- also stole this from mongodb site. it may not be necessary but idk i kinda like it if you wanna redo it. (could you include some frameworks in here too)

## Back-end

The back-end is the behind-the-scenes functionality of a web application. It processes user requests, applies business logic, and sends data back to the front-end via a *response*.

- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Manages *business logic* like calculating costs, applying discounts, and updating inventory.
  - Ensures security for sensitive data and transactions.
  - Handles user authentication and database communication.

- **Popular Languages**:
  - JavaScript (Node.js)
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Java
  - C#
  - PHP

- **Popular Tools**: Frameworks and libraries for back-end development include:
  - Express.js (JavaScript)
  - Flask (Python)
  - Java Spring (Java)
  - ASP.NET Core (C#)

> ðŸ“š *Business logic* refers to the application behavior that reflects real-world business rules. For instance, in an e-commerce app, it includes calculating shopping cart totals, applying discounts, and handling inventory.

tktk hunter - same as above

## Database

The data related to an application is persisted in a database. Certain kinds of data, such as textual, numeral, and boolean data, are highly suitable to be stored in a database as they can be easily cataloged, searched for, and retrieved.

Many database technologies are available, but some of the most popular are MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MySQL. Each of these has strengths and weaknesses.

### Two types of databases

There are two main types of databases: **relational databases** and **non-relational databases**.

- **Relational Databases**:
  - **How they store data**: In tables with rows and columns. Each row represents a single record, and each column represents a single attribute of that record.
  - **Use**: Widely used across various applications.
  - **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL

- **Non-Relational Databases**:
  - **How they store data**: In various formats such as documents, key-value pairs, and graphs.
  - **Use**: Suitable for applications with large amounts of unstructured data.
  - **Examples**: MongoDB

Relational databases are the most traditional and common, while non-relational databases offer flexible data models for specific use cases.


### How the three components work together

In a full-stack web application, the front-end, back-end, and database work together to provide a complete user experience. 

Let's bring it all together with an example.

A recipe creation website.

- **Front-End**: 
  - Presents a user interface for creating and viewing recipes.
  - Handles user input and sends *requests* to the back-end.

- **Back-End**: 
  - Processes *requests* from the front-end.
  - Performs create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on the database.
  - Sends *responses* back to the front-end.

- **Database**: 
  - Stores data, such as user-created recipes.
  - Can also track relationships and store user information.

This example illustrates how each component plays a crucial role in the functioning of a web application, working in unison to create, manage, and display data.

tktk Hunter: could use a diagram like the following, but more generic that only shows server and db without the driver, terminal, and database partitions:

> ðŸ“š In web development with JavaScript, the *Request* and *Response* objects are part of the Fetch API. These objects represent the data sent between the front-end and back-end of an application. They come with predefined methods and properties that simplify the process of making network requests and handling server responses. Learn more about the [Request Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request) and the [Response Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) on MDN Web Docs.
